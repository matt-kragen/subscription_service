## Overview
This application is a back-end API, made for a hypothetical tea subscription service. A user can use 3 endpoints to view their current or past subscriptions, create a new tea subscription, or cancel an existing subscription

## Tools Utilized
| Development | Testing         | Packages          |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| Ruby 2.7.2  | RSpec Rails     | FastJSON API      |
| Rails 5.2.6 | ShouldaMatchers | Factory Bot Rails |
| VSCode      | Postman         | Faker             |
|             | SimpleCov       | Pry               |
|             |                 | Rubocop Rails     |

## Local Setup

1. This application was built with Ruby 2.7.2. From the command line, run:
```sh
rbenv install 2.7.2
```
2. With rbenv you can set up your Ruby version for a directory and all subdirectories within it. Change into a directory that will eventually contain this repo and then run:
```sh
rbenv local 2.7.2
```
You can check that your Ruby version is correct with `ruby -v`

3. Once you have verified your Ruby version is 2.7.2, check if you have Rails. From the command line:
```sh
rails -v
```
4. If you get a message saying rails is not installed or you do not have version 5.2.6, run
```sh
gem install rails --version 5.2.6
```
5. You may need to quit and restart your terminal session to see these changes show up

## Endpoints
| Feature | Endpoint |
|-----|-----|
| Subscribe to a new tea subscription | `POST /api/v1/customers/:id/subscriptions` |
| Cancel a customer's tea subscription | `UPDATE /api/v1/customers/:id/subscriptions` |
| See all of a customerâ€™s subscriptions (active and cancelled) | `GET /api/v1/customers/:id/subscriptions` |

## Possible Extensions
The functionality of this application can be expanded upon in several ways.
e.g.
- Several packages are commented out in the Gemfile that are tied directly to API consumption
- Error handling was customized for the "Subscriptions" resource, but is built in such a way as to apply to all resources
- CRUD functionality through query params is possible, but can be restricted to JSON bodies
- If deployed, continuous integration through Travis or Circle CI is possible
